NB: Database table columns names are collectively referred to as schemas.
    Each column are individually referred to as fields.

============= DATA TYPES ============
- NULL:
- INTEGER:
- REAL(float/numeric)
- TEXT (char/ varchar)
- BLOB (Binary Larger Object): ie Images, videos, audios.


====== CREATING TABLE WITH FOREIGN KEY ===============
2 tables; dept and students.  dept has the primary key 'deptno' which is to be the foreign key for students table.

CREATE TABLE students(roll INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, city TEXT, deptno INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY(deptno) references dept(deptno));

NB: Foreign keys are not by default activated, we have to do so manually as shown below. Do this before inserting data into the table.
sqlite> PRAGMA FOREIGN_KEYS=ON;
